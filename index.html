    <p>Earth is the <strong>third planet</strong> from the sun and is the only known planet to support life, characterized by its large amounts of liquid water, a protective atmosphere, and active plate tectonics. It's an oblate spheroid with an approximate diameter of 12,756 km, composed of a solid inner and outer core, a mantle, and a rocky crust. The planet orbits the sun in about 365 days and rotates on its axis, completing one rotation in approximately 24 hours. Its surface is about 71% water and 29% land, with one moon that influences tides and helps stabilize the climate</p>
